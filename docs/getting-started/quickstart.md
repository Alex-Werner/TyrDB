# Quick start

### ES5/ES6 via NPM

In order to use this library in Node, you will need to add it to your project as a dependency.

Having [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed, just type in your terminal : 

```sh
npm install tyrdb
```

### CDN Standalone

For browser usage, you can also directly rely on unpkg :  

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tyrdb"></script>
```

### Initialization


```js
const TyrDB = require('tyrdb');
```
